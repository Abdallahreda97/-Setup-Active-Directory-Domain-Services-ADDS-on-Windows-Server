üñ•Ô∏è Setup Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) on Windows Server
üìå Project Summary
This project demonstrates how to install and configure Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) on a Windows Server machine, following the tutorial by Mohamed Zohdy.

As part of my continuous learning in IT infrastructure and Windows Server administration, I practiced setting up a domain environment from scratch to better understand enterprise-level user and group management.

‚úÖ Key Steps Implemented
Installed Windows Server 2019 and joined it to a private lab network.

Added the Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) role using Server Manager.

Promoted the server to a Domain Controller and configured a new domain.

Set the forest functional level and DNS delegation.

Successfully rebooted and verified domain setup.

üéØ Purpose of This Project
This lab was created as part of my training path to:

Understand Windows Server role configuration.

Practice domain creation and Active Directory structure.

Prepare for real-world system administration and SOC roles.
